# Code Review Style Guide

This guide outlines the principles and best practices for conducting code reviews for the Cloud Coffee Corner project. Our process is inspired by Google's internal engineering practices, focusing on maintaining and improving the overall code health of our codebase over time.

## The Standard of Code Review

The primary goal of code review is to ensure that a change improves the overall code health of the system. A pull request (PR) is considered "good enough" and should be approved if it meets this standard. It does not need to be perfect, but it must represent a net positive improvement.

This principle is key to avoiding "perfectionism paralysis" and maintaining development velocity. If a change is a clear improvement, it should be merged, even if further enhancements are possible.

## Reviewer Responsibilities

As a reviewer, your role is to be a guardian of the codebase. Your feedback should be timely, constructive, and clear.

*   **Timeliness:** Acknowledge a PR within a few hours of the request. Aim to complete the full review within one business day. A fast, iterative process is more effective than a slow, perfectionist one.
*   **Clarity:** Clearly distinguish between mandatory changes required to meet the code health standard and optional suggestions for improvement. If a comment is not mandatory, prefix it with `nit:` or `suggestion:`.
*   **Scope:** Focus on the substance of the change:
    *   **Design:** Does the change make sense? Does it align with our existing architecture?
    *   **Functionality:** Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
    *   **Complexity:** Is the code overly complex? Can it be simplified?
    *   **Tests:** Are the tests correct, sensible, and complete?
    *   **Readability:** Is the code easy to understand? Is it well-named and documented where necessary?
*   **Respect:** Always be respectful and professional. Frame feedback constructively and ask questions rather than making demands.

## Author Responsibilities

As the author of a PR, your role is to make the review process as efficient as possible for the reviewer.

*   **Focused PRs:** Create small, self-contained pull requests that are easy to understand. A single PR should address a single concern.
*   **Clear Descriptions:** Write a clear and concise PR description that explains the "what" and the "why" of the change. Link to the relevant GitHub issue.
*   **Self-Review:** Review your own code first. You will often catch simple mistakes before the reviewer does.
*   **Responsiveness:** Respond to every comment. If you are implementing a suggestion, state that you are doing so. If you are not, explain why.

## Navigating Disagreements

Disagreements are a natural part of the review process. The goal is to find the best outcome for the code, not for an individual to be "right."

1.  **Seek to Understand:** First, try to understand the reviewer's perspective.
2.  **Discuss:** If there is still a disagreement, have a face-to-face conversation or a quick call to resolve it.
3.  **Escalate:** If a consensus cannot be reached, escalate the issue to the team's tech lead. The tech lead will facilitate a discussion and help the team arrive at a decision that is in the best interest of the project.

By following these guidelines, we can ensure that our code review process is not only effective at maintaining code quality but also a positive and collaborative experience for everyone on the team.
