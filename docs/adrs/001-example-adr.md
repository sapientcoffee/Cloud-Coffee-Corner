# 1. Example ADR

## Status

Accepted

## Context

This is an example ADR to establish a format for recording architectural decisions.

We will use Markdown files stored in the `docs/adrs` directory to record architectural decisions. Each ADR will have a unique, sequential number.

## Consequences

- A clear, historical record of architectural decisions.
- A consistent format for future ADRs.
