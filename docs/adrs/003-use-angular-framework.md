# 3. Use Angular for Frontend Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a modern, robust, and well-supported framework for developing the frontend of the Cloud Coffee Corner application. The framework must support a component-based architecture, provide strong tooling for development and testing, and be suitable for building a scalable single-page application (SPA). The development team has experience with multiple modern frameworks.

## Decision

We will use **Angular** as the primary framework for frontend development.

## Consequences

### Positive

*   **Comprehensive and Opinionated:** Angular is a "batteries-included" framework. It provides built-in solutions for routing, state management, and data fetching (via its HTTP client). This reduces the need to make decisions about third-party libraries and ensures a consistent development pattern across the team.
*   **Strong Tooling:** The Angular CLI is a powerful tool that streamlines project creation, component generation, and the build process.
*   **TypeScript Support:** Angular is built with TypeScript, which provides static typing. This helps catch errors early, improves code quality, and makes the application easier to maintain and refactor.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Angular's component model aligns perfectly with our goal of building a modular and reusable UI.
*   **Long-Term Support:** As a Google-backed framework, Angular has a clear roadmap and long-term support, which is beneficial for the project's longevity.

### Negative

*   **Learning Curve:** Angular can have a steeper learning curve compared to other frameworks like React or Vue, especially for developers new to its specific patterns (e.g., modules, dependency injection).
*   **Verbosity:** The framework can sometimes be more verbose than alternatives, requiring more boilerplate code for components and services.
*   **Bundle Size:** While modern Angular has made significant improvements with its Ivy compiler, historically, its bundle sizes have been larger than competitors. This is a factor to monitor for performance.
